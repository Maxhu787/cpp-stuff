Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions 
that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. 
For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness 
of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. 
You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper 
formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own 
inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to 
answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. 
As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, 
so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions
you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where
indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be
able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, 
etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or
 some other page 
layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or
 primary key for each table. 
If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = {
		[business_id: 1115],
		[user_id: 9581]
	}
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = {
		[id: 10000],
		[business_id: 6493]
	}
viii. Tip = {
		[user_id: 537],
		[business_id: 3979]
	}
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."
	Answer:
		"no"
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

	Leavning reviews doesn't necessary get you more fans,
	but leaving at least one review will get you at least one fan,
	and without one review, you will certainly not get any.

	Code: 

	select review_count, fans from User
	/*order by review_count desc*/
	/*order by fans desc*/
	/*where review_count != 0 order by fans*/
	/*where fans != 0 and review_count is null*/

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or
 with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
		The word "love"
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select count(text) from review
	where text like "%love%"

	select count(text) from review
	where text like "%hate%"

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	select * from User
	order by fans desc
	limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

	+------------------------+-----------+--------------+---------------------+--------+--------+--------+------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
or
 category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars 
to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

The different distribution is only significant between the 2-star restaurant
versus the 4.5 stars restaurant that opens only from 10am to 6pm. 
There are no differences between the other restaurants.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

It is difficult to analyze due to the low numbers of businesses in the dataset for 
this particular group. There appears to be a correlation between low number of 
reviews and low star rating.

         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Not really. The zipcodes for all 5 businesses are all distinct. An additional analysis would need to 
place the GPS location in a map chart to see if the business are located in avenues or high-traffic streets.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT bus.id, bus.name, bus.city, cat.category, bus.stars, bus.review_count, hr.hours, bus.postal_code, bus.latitude, bus.longitude
FROM business bus
INNER JOIN category cat
ON bus.id = cat.business_id
INNER JOIN hours hr
ON bus.id = hr.business_id
WHERE bus.city = ‘Phoenix’ and cat.category=‘Restaurants’
ORDER BY by stars
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
		 The businesses that are OPEN tend to have > reviews than the ones that are CLOSED.
Open business: AVG(review_count) = 31.76
Closed business: AVG(review_count) = 23.2

         
ii. Difference 2:
         
		 The average star rating is higher for businesses that are OPEN than for businesses that are CLOSED.
Open: AVG(stars) = 3.68
Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.52

         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)), AVG(review_count), SUM(review_count), AVG(stars), is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open  
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis 
you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or
 anomalies between them, 
predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user 
will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to 
be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, 
to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

We want to try to analyse which factors contribute 
to businesses remaining open.

         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis 
and why you chose that data:

I want to help businesses understand the importance of various factors that contribute to predict if their business will stay open.
These factors in this case will be the business star rating, location, attributes, hours open, # of reviews.
We will gather the latitude and longitude as well as the complete address to make processing easier later on.
Categories will be used to better distinguish between different types of businesses.
The “is_open” column will flag whether the business in question is open, or has closed permanently.
